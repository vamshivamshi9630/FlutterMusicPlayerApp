# Windows Build Configuration for Music Player

## Issue
Firebase C++ SDK has Windows ABI conflicts that prevent the Windows build from compiling.

## Solution  
Firebase plugins are excluded from the Windows build while remaining available for Android and iOS.

## How It Works

1. **windows/flutter/generated_plugins.cmake** - Firebase plugins are listed but commented out:
   ```cmake
   list(APPEND FLUTTER_PLUGIN_LIST
     audioplayers_windows
     #cloud_firestore          ← Commented out
     connectivity_plus
     #firebase_auth            ← Commented out
     #firebase_core            ← Commented out
     #firebase_storage         ← Commented out
   )
   ```

2. **windows/CMakeLists.txt** - Extra safety check to remove any Firebase plugins from the build:
   ```cmake
   list(REMOVE_ITEM FLUTTER_PLUGIN_LIST
     firebase_auth
     firebase_core
     firebase_storage
     cloud_firestore
   )
   ```

## Important Notes

- **Firebase Packages**: Still listed in `pubspec.yaml` - this keeps Android and iOS builds intact
- **Dart Code**: Firebase imports are conditionally disabled in `lib/main.dart` for Windows (commented out)
- **Regeneration**: The `generated_plugins.cmake` file is regenerated by Flutter on each build - the commented Firebase entries will automatically be recreated if you use the file unmodified

## For Future Builds

If `flutter clean` regenerates `generated_plugins.cmake` with uncommented Firebase entries, simply re-comment them in the FLUTTER_PLUGIN_LIST section (lines 6-11) before building for Windows.

## Current Windows Build Status

Windows builds are experiencing unrelated CMake/build infrastructure errors:
- `cmake -E tar: error: ZIP decompression failed (-5)`

This is a Flutter SDK issue with Windows builds, not related to Firebase or the app code. Android builds remain fully functional with Firebase integration intact.
